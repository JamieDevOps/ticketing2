This is a test git file for cohort8. The expectation is that at the end of this lecture, we would have:

1) Refreshed our memory on the last class
2. Learnt about git branches
3. Open a git repository
4. Push a code from the local repository to the remote repo
Adding a line of text from bugfix master
we are adding this line from the CLI after our first git push/pull
Just to ascertain that we can try to pull directly from remote repo
